# pip.ai
pip.ai is a Currency Exchange Monitor & Alert Agent. It is a Python-based tool that allows users to track and receive alerts on currency exchange rate fluctuations. This project uses the uAgent library to create a user-friendly interface and to interact with a currency exchange API to provide real-time exchange rate data.

## Features
* **Base Currency Selection**: Users can choose their preferred base currency, which serves as the reference currency for exchange rate comparisons.
* **Monitor Multiple Foreign Currencies**: Users can select one or more foreign currencies they wish to monitor against their chosen base currency.
* **Real-Time Exchange Rate Data**: The application connects to a currency exchange API to fetch up-to-date exchange rates.
* **Threshold Alerts**: Users can set custom threshold values for each monitored currency pair. The system will notify them when the exchange rate crosses these thresholds.
* **Notification Alerts**: The tool sends alerts or notifications to users through emails.

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the Currency Exchange Monitor & Alert Agent:
1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this project's Git repository to your local machine.
2. **Prerequisites**
     * Python (3.9+ is required)
     * Poetry (a packaging and dependency management tool for Python)
3. ```
   cd src
   ```
4. **Setup for .env File**:<br>
Update the values of placeholders in .env.example and **rename the file to .env**
    * **API Access**: Obtain an API key from (https://app.currencyapi.com/register) by signing in with your emailID
      (Note that if youâ€™ve run out of your request limit, you will not be able to get results for this project.)
    * **Obtain APP_PASSWORD**: Follow the steps in the [link](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en) to setup APP_PASSWORD for your gmail account<br>
    * **For AGENT_SEED**(Optional): Add any random pass phrase
    * **For AGENT_ADDRESS**(For Exchange and Notify Agents Address): Run the main.py file
        ```
        poetry run python main.py
        ```
        you need to look for the following output in the logs:<br>
        ```
        Adding Exchange agent to Bureau : {exchange_agent.address}
        Adding Notify agent to Bureau : {notify_agent.address}
        ```
      
        This is your AGENT's ADDRESS, Copy the {agent.address} value into .env file <br>
Once you have all the keys, update the .env file
5. Run index.py as
     ```
     poetry run streamlit run index.py
     ```
6. **To input user Preference**:<br>
    * You'll be redirected to local host.
      * Click on Create Page
      * Fill the form
      * Click on Submit
    * **To update user preferences**:
      * Click on Update Page
      * Update pref and Submit

7. Open a new terminal (leave the current one as it is) and navigate to src folder to run the file.
    ```
    cd src
    poetry run python main.py
    ```
Once you press enter, a request will be sent to the agent every 10 minutes, you will be able to see your result in your console and critical alerts will be sent on your gmail account.
